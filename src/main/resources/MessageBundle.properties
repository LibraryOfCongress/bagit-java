#for BagitWarning.java
bag_within_a_bag=A data directory can contain anything, including another bag. However it would be better to merge the bags together.
different_case=The bag contains two files that differ only in case. This can cause problems on a filesystem like the one used by apple (HFS).
different_normalization=The bag contains two files that differ only in the normalization. This can cause verification to fail on some systems, and general user confusion.
extra_lines_in_bagit_files=The Bagit specification says it must only contain 2 lines. However, some implementations have decided to ignore this which may cause compatibility issues
leading_dot_slash=A manifest lists all data files as relative to the bag root directory, it is superfluous to therefore specify it with a dot.
non_standard_algorithm=The checksum algorithm used does not come standard with the Java runtime. Consider using SHA-512 instead.
md5sum_tool_generated_manifest=The manifest was created using checksum utilities such as those contained in the GNU Coreutils package (md5sum, sha1sum, etc.), collectively referred to here as 'md5sum'. This creates slight differences in generated manifests that can cause problems in some implementations.
missing_tag_manifest=The tag manifest guards against a truncated payload manifest as well as other potential problems and is always recommended that it be included.
old_bagit_version=The Bagit specification version is not the newest. Consider converting to the latest version.
os_specific_files=Files created by the operating system (OS) for its own use. They are non-portable across OS versions and should not be included in any manifest. Examples Thumbs.db on Windows or .DS_Store on OS X
payload_oxum_missing=It is recommended to always include the Payload-Oxum in the bag metadata since it allows for a 'quick verification' of the bag.
tag_files_encoding=It is recommended to always use UTF-8.
weak_checksum_algorithm=The checksum algorithm used is known to be weak. We recommend using SHA-512.
manifest_file_sets_differ_between_algorithms=As of bagit version 1.0 it is recommended that all payload manifests contain the same set of files as other payload manifests. It is also recommended that all tag manifests contain the same set of files as other tag manifests.

bag_missing_tag_manifest_warning=Bag [{}] does not contain a tag manifest. It is recommended to always include a tag manifest.
different_case_warning=In manifest [{}], path [{}] is the same as another path except for the case. This can cause problems if moving the bag to a filesystem that is case insensitive.
